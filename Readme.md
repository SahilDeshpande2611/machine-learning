# Heart Disease Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict the presence of heart disease based on clinical data.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Model training and evaluation (Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, SVM)
- Model saving for deployment

## Dataset

The dataset (`heart.csv`) should be placed in the project directory.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Create `requirements.txt` with necessary packages if needed)*

2. Run the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook heart_disease.ipynb
    ```

3. Follow the notebook cells for data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## Exporting Models

Trained models and scalers are saved as `.pkl` files for later use.
